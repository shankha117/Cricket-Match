# **`CRICKET MATCH`**



## **`Description`**

It's the finals of the T20 Cup! Bengaluru and Chennai, neighbours and
fierce rivals, are fighting it out for the title. Bengaluru's star
batsman Kirat is at the crease. Can he win it for Bengaluru?

It's the last 4 overs of the match. Bengaluru needs 40 runs to win and with 4 wickets left. Each
player has a different probability for scoring runs. 

The program simulates the match, ball by ball. The match simulation uses a weighted random number generation based on
probability to determine the runs scored per ball.
